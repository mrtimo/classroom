## Introduction
Github was built as a web front end for git hosted solutions. 
> What is git? Git enables you to edit code at the same time as other people. It is like google docs for code. 
> Pretty useful, right?

Before you sign up for a github account, do you have a Gravatar? It might be a good idea to get one...
Go sign up for an account on GitHub.

Github has millions of users, hosting millions of repositories of code. How do they make money?

Github has it's own lingo. Here is are some of the common terms used on github:

## Six things to do with github (as homework and in-class assignment):

1. Search for interesting projects, and "watch them" or star them. 
2. Create a markdown file. With the following 
 - Bulleted lists
 - Links to the web or other github projects
 - Code snippets of one line and multiple lines
 - Images
 - Tables
>Then fork this document, edit the last line to add a link to your markdown file, then submit a pull request.
3. Fork several projects that look interesting to you. 
4. Create a github page of your own (Read about "github pages")
5. Learn about fork-n-go [https://github.com/jlord/sheetsee.js/blob/master/docs/fork-n-go.md] and fork someones github page as your own.
6. Fork one of these http://jlord.us/blog/fork-n-go, and then edit this document again (as you did in step 2), adding a link to your page on the last line.
